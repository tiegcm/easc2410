    "### 2. Spherical Harmonic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics and physical science, spherical harmonics are special functions defined on the surface of a sphere. Spherical harmonics are important in many theoretical and practical applications, e.g., in Earth Sciences, they are used extensively in representating gravitational fields, geoids and geomagnetic fields  (the IGRF is basically a bunch of spherical harmonic functions!). The 3-D distributions of spherical harmonic functions can be found here, for example: https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalHarmonic.html. Now let's try generate some 3-D shapes of spherical harmonic functions using Axes3D. \n",
    "\n",
    "To generate 3-D spherical harmonic functions, you will be working with two coordinate systems: Cartesian $(x,y,z)$ and Spherical $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$. Here $\\theta$ is the latitude (from 0 to $\\pi$) and $\\phi$ is the longitude (from 0 to $2\\pi$). The relationship between the two coordinate system is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x = r\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi$$\n",
    "$$y = r\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi$$\n",
    "$$z = r\\cos\\theta\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:$$\n",
    "\n",
    "so once we know $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$, we can convert the location to $(x,y,z)$ using the above equation since Axes3D works only in Cartesian geometry. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's visualize the simplest spherical harmonic function: $Y_{1,0}=\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}}\\cos\\theta$:\n",
    "    * generate a 2-D mesh of ($\\phi$,$\\theta$) with $100\\times 200$ points using numpy's meshgrid() function\n",
    "    * compute the spherical function $\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4\\pi}}\\cos\\theta$ and, say assign the values to a new array named $Y$\n",
    "    * convert the spherical coordinates $(r,\\theta,\\phi)$ back to $(x,y,z)$ so that the plot_surface() function can be used to draw the surface. Here $\\theta$, $\\phi$ are the 2-D mesh (arrays), and $r$ is assigned to be $|Y|$. In other words, you're mapping $(|Y|,\\theta,\\phi)$ back to $(x,y,z)$\n",
    "    * use plot_surface() to generate the shape of the spherical harmonic function $Y_{1,0}$ using $|Y|$ as the z-value in the function input. The trick here is that if $|Y|=1$, then you get a surface; other wise $|Y|$ varies as a function of $(\\theta,\\phi)$, and the shape of the 3-D surface changes accordingly.\n",
    "    * label your figure properly\n",
    "- Generate another three spherical harmonic functions:\n",
    "$$Y_{1,2}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{15}{\\pi}}\\cos\\theta\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:$$\n",
    "$$Y_{2,3}=\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{105}{\\pi}}\\sin^2\\theta\\cos\\theta\\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:\\:$$\n",
    "$$Y_{2,4}=\\frac{3}{8}\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{\\pi}}\\sin^2\\theta\\left(7\\cos^2\\theta-1\\right)\\left(\\cos^2\\phi-\\sin^2\\phi\\right)$$"

There are multiple ways to proceed, one method is to use scipy's griddata function (you need to do a little bit research on \"data gridding/interpolation\" using the griddata() function) to convert a list of 1-D elevation data into a 2-D array with a new mesh."
