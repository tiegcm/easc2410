    "Today, let's take a  break from programming in Python and discuss file systems, paths, and the command line. Why?  Because whenever you import your data files into the Jupyter notebook (recall the examples we've seen using NumPy functions), you have to tell Python **where** in the computer the file is *located*. Moreover as a good practice, there are many command line functions that come in handy. For example, you can look at the first few lines of a file before you import it into the notebook. You could also write all of your programs in a text editor and run those programs from the command line. You could then run your programs from anywhere on your computer instead of a jupyter notebook.

    "Pandas is a relatively new package for Python (a few years old).  It allows us to read in more complicated data file formats than **NumPy**, and  wrangle the data in powerful ways. It also provides many useful data analysis tools. Here is the documentation of the Pandas library: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/\n",

This kind of file does not play nicely with **np.loadtxt( )** or **np.genfromtxt( )**,  but we can use the **Pandas function**, **read_csv( )** to read in the datafile.  This function not only reads in 'comma separated variable' files (.csv), but also other data formats once we tell it how the file is delimited.  \n",
